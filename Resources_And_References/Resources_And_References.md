## Computer Science Foundations

### 🎓 Harvard CS50x – Online Introduction to Computer Science  
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/

CS50x is Harvard University's free online version of their famous computer science course.  
I followed the online lectures and worked through several of the problem sets when I had time, but I did not submit all assignments nor take the final exam — so I did not obtain the certificate.  
However, the course still gave me a solid foundation in:

- C programming basics  
- Memory management  
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees)  
- Algorithms and computational thinking  
- Computer architecture fundamentals  
- Web basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  

### 🔍 Why CS50x helps my cybersecurity journey  
Even without completing the final exam, CS50x strengthened my technical base.  
It helped me better understand:

- How programs execute at low level  
- How memory works (crucial for malware behaviour)  
- How data structures relate to log indexing & SIEM logic  
- How the OS manages processes and resources  
- How web technologies function behind the scenes  

CS50x gives me the computer science mindset needed to analyze behaviour, understand anomalies, and reason about system internals — all essential for SOC work.
