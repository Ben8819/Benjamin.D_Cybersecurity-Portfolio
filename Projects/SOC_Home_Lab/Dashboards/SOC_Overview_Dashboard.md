# SOC Overview Dashboard

## Purpose

The **SOC Overview Dashboard** provides a **high-level view of the security posture** of the lab environment.  
It is designed to be the **first dashboard a SOC analyst checks** to quickly determine whether the environment is behaving normally or requires investigation.

This dashboard intentionally prioritizes **clarity and signal over depth**, acting as a gateway to more detailed dashboards.

---

## Data Sources

This dashboard aggregates events from multiple sources:

- Host-based logs (Linux authentication and system logs)
- Network-based IDS alerts (Suricata)
- Firewall logs (pfSense)
- Centralized log ingestion via Splunk

By correlating these sources, the dashboard enables **cross-layer visibility** (host, network, and perimeter).

---

## Dashboard Design Philosophy

The SOC Overview Dashboard follows common SOC principles:

- High-level metrics first
- Visual detection of anomalies
- Minimal analyst friction
- Fast interpretation without deep log analysis

Each panel answers a **single operational question** an analyst would ask at the start of a monitoring session.

Note: The SPL queries used to build and validate this dashboard panels are documented as screenshots in the dedicated [SPL/] folder.

## Dashboard Panels

### 1. Total Events (All Sources)

**Purpose:**  
Display the **total number of security-related events** ingested from all sources.

**What it shows:**
- Aggregated count of all indexed events
- Includes host logs, firewall logs, and IDS alerts

**SOC Value:**  
Provides immediate confirmation that:
- Log ingestion is working correctly
- The environment is active
- No silent logging failures are occurring

This metric establishes the **baseline activity level**.

### 2. Suricata Signal vs Noise

**Purpose:**  
Visualize the ratio between **alert-generating traffic** and **non-alert traffic**.

**What it shows:**
- Suricata alerts
- Non-alert (benign) network traffic

**SOC Value:**  
Helps analysts:
- Assess IDS tuning quality
- Confirm that alerts represent a minority of traffic
- Detect excessive noise or misconfiguration

A healthy IDS produces **far more benign traffic than alerts**, while still detecting meaningful events.

### 3. Firewall Logs (pfSense)

**Purpose:**  
Show the total volume of firewall events generated by pfSense.

**What it shows:**
- Aggregated count of firewall log entries
- Includes allowed and blocked traffic (depending on pfSense logging settings)

**SOC Value:**  
Indicates:
- Firewall visibility is operational
- Network traffic is flowing through the perimeter
- Rule activity matches expected behavior

This panel helps detect misconfigured rules or unexpected drops.

### 4. Total IDS Alerts

**Purpose:**  
Provide a **global count of IDS alerts** generated by Suricata.

**What it shows:**
- Total number of IDS alert events
- Independent of severity or category

**SOC Value:**  
Used to:
- Detect alert spikes
- Validate IDS detection during attack simulations
- Measure the impact of tuning and noise reduction

This panel is a **high-level IDS health indicator**.

### 5. Top Host by Event Volume

**Purpose:**  
Identify which hosts are generating the most events.

**What it shows:**
- Hosts ordered by total event count
- Includes SIEM server, admin workstation, servers, and firewall

**SOC Value:**  
Helps analysts:
- Spot noisy or misconfigured systems
- Identify investigation starting points
- Understand where most activity originates

High volume does not imply malicious behavior but **warrants context**.

## Analyst Workflow Example

Typical usage flow:

1. Open the SOC Overview Dashboard
2. Confirm log ingestion via total event count
3. Check IDS signal vs noise balance
4. Review IDS alert volume
5. Identify top event-generating hosts
6. Pivot to deeper dashboards (authentication, IDS threats, firewall investigations)

This workflow mirrors **real SOC Tier-1 monitoring practices**.

---

## Detection Capabilities Demonstrated

This dashboard supports early detection of:

- Authentication abuse patterns
- Network reconnaissance activity
- IDS alert spikes
- Firewall rule anomalies
- Logging or ingestion failures

It provides **direction**, not conclusions.

---

## Limitations

- No automated alerting or SOAR actions
- Limited enrichment at overview level
- Manual analyst interpretation required

These limitations are intentional and reflect **entry-level SOC environments**.

---

## Summary

The SOC Overview Dashboard serves as:

- A centralized monitoring entry point
- A fast anomaly detection surface
- A realistic SOC-style situational awareness tool
- The foundation for deeper investigation workflows
