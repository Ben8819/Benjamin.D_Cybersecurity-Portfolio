# Authentication Monitoring Dashboard

## Objective

The Authentication Monitoring Dashboard provides visibility into **host-based authentication activity** within the lab environment.

Its objectives are to:

- Monitor authentication activity volume over time
- Detect abnormal spikes in login-related events
- Identify authentication failures that may indicate brute-force behavior
- Provide quick access to recent authentication logs for investigation

This dashboard focuses on **visibility and analysis**, not automated blocking.

---

## Data Source

Authentication events are collected from Linux hosts using **Splunk Universal Forwarders**.

**Log source:**
- `/var/log/auth.log`

**Indexed into:**
- Splunk (host-based logs)

The dashboard reflects authentication activity generated by:
- SSH sessions
- PAM authentication events
- System services (e.g. cron jobs)
- Local user authentication

---

Note: The SPL queries used to build and validate this dashboard panels are documented as screenshots in the dedicated [SPL/] folder.

## Dashboard Panels

### 1. Activity Over Time

**Panel name:** `Activity over time`

**Description:**
Displays the total number of authentication-related events over time, including both successful and unsuccessful activity.

**Purpose:**
- Establish a baseline of authentication behavior
- Identify sudden spikes caused by scripted activity, service behavior, or testing

**Security relevance:**
A sharp increase in events may indicate:
- Automated login attempts
- Brute-force testing
- Misconfigured or noisy services

### 2. Recent Authentication Activity

**Panel name:** `Recent auth activity`

**Description:**
Tabular view showing the most recent authentication-related log entries.

**Fields displayed:**
- `_time`
- `host`
- `source`
- Raw authentication log message

**Purpose:**
- Provide immediate context during investigations
- Validate suspicious behavior without running manual searches
- Distinguish user activity from system-generated events

### 3. Authentication Failures Over Time (Brute Force Visibility)

**Panel name:** `Authentication Failures Over Time (BruteForce Visibility)`

**Description:**
Time-based visualization showing failed authentication attempts only.

**Purpose:**
- Detect clustering of authentication failures
- Identify time windows where brute-force behavior may be occurring

**Security relevance:**
Repeated failures within short timeframes may indicate:
- Brute-force attacks
- Password guessing attempts
- Misconfigured authentication mechanisms

This panel focuses on **patterns**, not isolated failures.

### 4. Host Generating Authentication Failures

**Panel name:** `Host Generating Auth Failures`

**Description:**
Bar chart showing which host is responsible for authentication failures.

**Purpose:**
- Quickly identify the source of failed authentication attempts
- Distinguish attacker-controlled hosts from legitimate systems

**Security relevance:**
Useful for detecting:
- Compromised hosts
- Internal attack simulations
- Noisy or misbehaving systems

### 5. Authentication Failures vs Success

**Panel name:** `Authentication Failures vs Success`

**Description:**
Pie chart comparing authentication outcomes.

**Categories displayed:**
- Success
- Failure
- Other (non-login PAM or system activity)

**Purpose:**
- Provide a high-level overview of authentication health
- Highlight the ratio of failed logins versus normal activity

**Important note:**
Not all authentication log entries represent security incidents.

### 6. Total Authentication Events

**Panel name:** `Total authentication events`

**Description:**
Single-value visualization showing the total number of authentication-related events in the selected time range.

**Purpose:**
- Provide quick situational awareness
- Help establish a baseline before and after attack simulations

See below screenshot:<br>

## Example SOC Use Case

An analyst reviewing this dashboard may:

1. Observe a spike in authentication failures
2. Identify the source host generating the failures
3. Review recent authentication logs for context
4. Correlate activity with IDS or firewall events
5. Determine whether escalation is required

This mirrors a real SOC investigation workflow.

---

## Detection Coverage

This dashboard supports visibility into:

- Brute-force authentication attempts  
  *(MITRE ATT&CK: T1110 – Brute Force)*
- Abnormal authentication patterns
- Credential misuse indicators

Detection relies on **analyst interpretation**, not automated response.

---

## Design Decisions & Limitations

- No automated blocking or alerting is implemented
- System-generated authentication noise is expected
- Single failures are not treated as incidents
- Correlation with other dashboards is required for confidence

This reflects realistic SOC monitoring conditions.

---

## Summary

The Authentication Monitoring Dashboard provides:

- Clear visibility into authentication behavior
- Brute-force detection through pattern analysis
- Fast access to raw authentication logs
- A realistic SOC-style monitoring experience

It forms a foundational component of the lab’s security monitoring architecture.
