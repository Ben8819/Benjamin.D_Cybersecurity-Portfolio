## SOC Investigation Workflow

This section describes the analytical workflow followed when investigating alerts generated by the lab environment.  
The goal is to demonstrate a structured SOC-style approach rather than isolated tool usage.

### 1. Alert Ingestion

All security-relevant events are centrally collected in Splunk from multiple sources:

- Suricata IDS (network-based alerts)
- Linux authentication logs (SSH, sudo)
- pfSense firewall logs
- System logs from servers and workstations

This ensures visibility across both **network** and **host** layers.

---

### 2. Initial Alert Triage

The first step is to assess alert context and severity:

- Alert source (IDS vs authentication vs firewall)
- Alert frequency and repetition
- Affected hosts and services
- Time correlation between events

Dashboards are used to quickly answer:
- Is this a one-off event or repeated activity?
- Is the behavior consistent with normal usage?

---

### 3. Noise Filtering and Validation

A significant portion of IDS alerts represent sensor noise or expected behavior.

Actions taken:
- Identification of recurring benign signatures (e.g. retransmissions, malformed packets)
- Classification of alerts into:
  - **Benign (Sensor Noise)**
  - **Suspicious**
- Refinement of dashboards to focus on actionable alerts only

This step is critical to prevent alert fatigue and maintain signal clarity.

---

### 4. Correlation Across Data Sources

Suspicious alerts are validated by correlating multiple data types:

- Network alerts from Suricata
- Authentication failures or successes
- Firewall connection logs
- Source and destination IP consistency

Example:
- Repeated SSH authentication failures
- Corresponding IDS alerts for abnormal connection behavior
- Same source IP observed across multiple logs

Correlation strengthens confidence in detection accuracy.

---

### 5. Timeline Reconstruction

For validated suspicious activity, a timeline is built:

- Initial connection attempts
- Escalation in frequency or intensity
- Presence or absence of successful authentication
- Duration of the activity

This helps distinguish between:
- Misconfigurations
- Automated scans
- Active attack attempts

---

### 6. Impact Assessment

Each incident is evaluated for potential impact:

- Was access successfully obtained?
- Were privileged accounts involved?
- Was lateral movement observed?

---

### 7. Recommended Response Actions

Based on findings, potential response actions are identified:

- Temporary IP blocking via firewall rules
- Credential review for targeted accounts
- Increased monitoring of affected hosts
- Alert escalation if behavior persists

These recommendations mirror real SOC escalation paths.

### Outcome

This workflow demonstrates:
- Structured incident analysis
- Effective noise reduction
- Cross-source correlation
- SOC-ready investigation methodology
