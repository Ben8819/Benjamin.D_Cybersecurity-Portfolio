# 1. SIEM Tools

## Splunk  
- SPL searches  
- Field extraction  
- Dashboards  
- Event correlation  
- Data normalization  

## Elastic (Kibana)  
- KQL queries  
- Visualizations  
- Timeline analysis  

## Wazuh  
- Host-based monitoring  
- Rules & alerts  
- File integrity monitoring

# 2. Packet Analysis

## Wireshark  
- Filters (`dns`, `http.request`, `tcp.flags.syn==1`)  
- Follow TCP Stream  
- Protocol inspection  
- Detecting anomalies  

## tcpdump  
- Quick CLI capture  
- Useful for triage on servers

# 3. Network Tools

## Nmap  
- Host discovery  
- Port scanning  
- Service fingerprinting  
- NSE basics  

## GNS3  
- Network simulation  
- NAT, routing, ACL tests  
- Traffic generation

# 4. Endpoint Analysis

## Windows  
- Event Viewer  
- Sysmon  
- Registry analysis  
- Service enumeration  

## Linux  
- Syslog  
- auth.log  
- journalctl  
- Hardening basics

# 5. IDS / IPS Tools

## Snort  
- Signature-based detection  
- Custom rules  
- Tuning false positives
