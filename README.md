# Benjamin’s Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

## 👋 About Me

I’m Benjamin — an IT professional transitioning into cybersecurity, with over 6 years of hands-on experience in IT support and a growing focus on blue team operations.

My strengths come from a combination of real-world troubleshooting, technical curiosity, and disciplined self-study in networking, system internals, log analysis, and core security fundamentals.

This repository contains my hands-on cybersecurity and IT projects, learning notes, and technical references, and reflects my practical approach to learning and applying defensive security concepts.

## 🎯 My Goals


### **1️⃣ Primary Goal — Secure my first SOC / Blue Team role**

My top priority is to transition from IT Support into a full cybersecurity position, ideally as a Junior SOC Analyst.  
Everything I learn, practice, and document in this portfolio is oriented toward building the technical and analytical skills required for real SOC work:

- log analysis  
- SIEM workflows  
- threat detection  
- incident triage  
- network traffic analysis  
- understanding attacker behavior  

This is the next step in my career, and the core focus of my learning path.

<br>

### **2️⃣ Build strong, practical cybersecurity abilities**

To prepare for SOC roles, I'm actively working on:

- Windows & Linux log analysis  
- Sysmon and event-based detection  
- SIEM tools (Splunk, Elastic, Wazuh)  
- Networking & packet analysis  
- Python scripting for automation  
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Blue team fundamentals  

<br>

### **3️⃣ Maintain long-term, structured learning habits**

Beyond job readiness, I aim to continue expanding my foundational knowledge in:

- cybersecurity
- networking  
- operating systems  
- Python & scripting  
- SQL  
- computer science principles  
- cloud & identity basics
 
These fundamentals make me stronger over time and increase my ability to investigate effectively.

<br>

### **4️⃣ Share my journey with the IT & cybersecurity community**

This repo is public on purpose.  
I want my documentation, labs, mistakes, and progress to:
- help others who are entering the field  
- show my transparency and growth  
- contribute to the learning culture of cybersecurity  

<br>

### **5️⃣ Build a personal knowledge base I can grow indefinitely**

This portfolio evolves with me — it’s a living record of my experience.
As I grow from IT Support → SOC Analyst → more advanced roles, this repository will continue to track:
- projects  
- labs  
- tools  
- ideas  
- scripts  
- research
